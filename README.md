# üó£üñ•Ô∏è Talk To Your Terminal 

Skilled developers build muscle memory and navigate the terminal effortlessly, instantly recalling commands 
and aliases. But what if we could make things.. a lot less precise?

Introducing Talk To Your Terminal - a new, wildly unpredictable way to interact with your computer. 
Using your voice, you can finally express joy and frustration at your terminal in a natural manner.
